# teaching
This repo will have things related to the courses I teach (e.g. GIS, dendrochronology, geoscience). 

These course materials can also be found on my WordPress site, with links to the Google Drive
folders that contain each course material. Moving forward I hope to continue to streamline the
functionality of GitHub, WordPress, and GoogleDrive to share my materials seamlessly across platforms.
